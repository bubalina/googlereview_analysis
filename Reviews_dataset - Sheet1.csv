Scotty P,FALSE,2,2022-01-29T01:45:32.015Z,5,"**Get it while you can. White spot Edmonton is closing on February 6th, 2022**
 
 A little bit of British Columbia in Edmonton. White Spot is a chain of restaurants in BC and I'm glad that we have one here in Edmonton.
 
 One of my favorites is the dippin' chicken which my picky eater loves. Their menu is scaled back at the moment due to covid; but, still has plenty of options to choose from.
 
 If you need a family restaurant this is a great option as they have meal sets for kids which includes a fun kids menu and a cardboard pirate ship for the kids to keep.
 
 The staff are awesome and friendly and make you feel welcome."

Ryan,TRUE,0,2021-12-07T16:19:44.845Z,5,"Fantastic fish and chips! When I lived in BC the local White Spot was a regular haunt. It was a well-regarded local chain of family restaurants. Nostalgia drew me here but this place was much better than the White Spot restaurants I knew back on the coast. The servers were great, patient and friendly. The room is mainly booths, with soft lighting and warm colours and it feels like a nice place to be. For me, that alone makes it worth the drive to visit this place. The meal is what makes me look forward to making this trip again though. Back on the coast, my standard White Spot choice was fish & chips. That was what I had when I visited here but the food here was so much better than I remembered! They used fresh halibut and home made chips, even a scratch-made tartar sauce. Absolutely great! I usually try to avoid chain restaurants but this place is a definite exception. Everything was done with care and attentions and the service was excellent. Next time I get a craving for great fish &chips; this is where you’ll find me."

George Nixon,TRUE,0,2021-12-03T13:26:36.944Z,1,An incredibly disappointing burger. For $15.49 a big juicy cheeseburger with tasty toppings should be placed before you; not the McDonald's kid's meal hamburger that they allow themselves to present. I felt offended.

While our server was clearly doing her best, and brought out an order of fries to calm down two hangry girls, the manager who spoke to us was horrendous. Firstly he claimed they were out of turkey due to skip the dishes, ever though we had preordered l our order had been reassigned. Then after fourty five min waiting we werr told they had turkey, but no potatoes and at 5:30 pm it was ""too late to start peeling and cooking more potatoes"" while the resturaunt continued to ship our a Skip the Dishes orders at 1 order ever 6 min, which was apalling to watch from out booth with two screaming toddlers.

 ______________________________
 
 My partner Ange works from home in a high powered role. Her company had a virtual luncheon and I had pre-ordered her lunch through skip the dishes. The options are out there of who to chose for your dining.
 I specifically selected White spot as they are particularly close to our home.
 
 Very disappointingly the food was delivered by skip the dishes!! Upon delivery they did not ring out camera doorbell thus the food stayed outside awaiting collection. Ange was on a video zoom call and was unaware the food had already been delivered due to putting her phone on silent during the zoom call
 
 It was our first time ordering from this company and it will be our last!
 
 Having called the manager to let him know about the service an attempt was made by the manager Rob to resolve the situation by offering a voucher. He confirmed he would come to the house to personally deliver this which was sincerely appreciated at the time. Rob had confirmed he was going to come by at around 5:00 by 7:30 p.m. he was a no-show. Again calling White Spot we were told that he did not leave white spot.
 
 It is so disappointing during the time of this pandemic, Covid19, you would think all restaurants are happy to have customers to provide them with business that they would put a priority on this to ensure they have a return on business; sadly to say this was not the issue yesterday.
 
 Disappointing service .... Would not recommend."

Marni,TRUE,0,2021-05-30T02:04:48.767Z,1,"Being from BC we have been eating at White Spot since my partner and I have been kids. We’ve always enjoyed it and when we moved to Calgary a few years back we continued to go until they closed down. The Triple O’s that opened way down in the industrial area of Calgary was our go to place after that and it was always really good. We then moved to Edmonton and decided to try the only one here at the Hotel on Ellerslie. What a huge disappointment. When did White Spot start using generic frozen patties? We ordered the Legendary Family Pack as always only to find no salad with any of them and soggy underdone fries. The burgers were a tasteless mess and they overcharged us by $11.00, what that extra $11.00 was for I do not know. We found this out once we arrived home with our food and looked in the bags and then looked at the bill. It was going to cost us more (gas) just to drive back so we did not. We then realized they had also forgotten our drinks but we were in a hurry so we should have realized that before we headed home. I have to say we will never be back to this location. Being such huge fans of White Spot we find this very disappointing. If I wanted a frozen hamburger patty I would go buy frozen burgers and if I wanted soggy underdone fries...well, I have never wanted either of those things but that is what we paid good money for tonight!"

 We ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes, sausage, fruit and a chocolate shake.
 
 First off, they sent back bacon instead of normal bacon. The pancakes were basically rubber and we didn’t eat those. The chocolate shake was melted and gross by the time it got up to our room, and the “fresh fruit” we ordered was just 3 grapes, half of an apple cut up and some pineapple chunks. They also charged us a “delivery fee” to bring it to our room, which no one told me about and I didn’t know until I read the receipt.
 
 We paid $40 with the tip for this, and over half of it went straight in the garbage. No napkins, plates or anything either, which is really weird for room service.
 Don’t waste your money."

Christopher Gaul,TRUE,2,2019-10-29T01:49:00.388Z,4,"Recommended. Original review below.
 
 *UPDATE 2:* The current menu seems to have found a better balance between variety, quality, and price than the previous menu mentioned below. This is back to being on my recommended list.
 
 *UPDATE:* they recently revamped their menu and while the quality of the food and service remain the same (both are quite decent) their prices have nearly doubled! That makes their value and rating go down since there are too many tough competitors in the price range they've put themselves in.

 Nice variety of good food at decent prices. Decor is fancy enough for a meeting or date but relaxed enough to enjoy anytime. Good service rounds out an overall nice experience. Recommended.
 Oh and try the burgers and the bottomless fries!"

The omelette was the worst part. It was runny and watery and over salted like crazy. We had a bite each and left everything on the table. The manager came to ask what was wrong and took 7 dollars off a 60 dollar bill. Are you kidding me? You have customers who said the food was gross, didn't eat it and you just took off 7 dollars? At least try to offer to remake the food or at least cover the bill so we would want to come back because of the experience. Don't slap a customer in the face by taking 7 dollars off of food that is still on the plate. Do yourself a favour and go to Denny's next door."

The side of fries I ordered came with about half a medium potato worth of fries which is fairly small serving. The fries were soggy and unappetizing. The server never came around which might be lucky since I was tempted to order something good instead of the slop I got handed but if the cooks (because there is clearly no chef of any kind in their kitchens.) were willing to serve what they did, then ordering anything else would be a bit of a gambit. A year ago you guys were 5 star now you barely make two. What changed in that time to make you immoral food slaughterers? You just lost a die hard fan. R.I.P. Chicken Pot soup and fries. P. S. The Chipotle mayo was still really good. Focus on firing your staff and replacing them with Chipotle mayo until you can find people who can both serve without looking like they're dying on the inside and chefs who can cook."

 Only downside I have seen from the many times I have come is that one time there was puke absolutely everywhere in the dining area and not a single waitress was willing to clean it. The bathroom was also covered in puke when I took my daughter to use it. The place wasn't busy as there was only my family and one other group of people, so it very disappointing to see that no one was taking care of it. It was there the whole time we were there, and just got cleaned as we were leaving. That's almost an hour of puke sitting there, and it was already there when we arrived."

When my fiance asked for over medium eggs, she received over easy eggs. No one asked how our meal was, no one offered to refill our coffees, and the server didn't bother asking if we wanted the cheque when she took our plates away. I had to seek someone out for our bill. Definitely not coming back; I get better service and the same quality of food at the McDonald's across the street."
Kriselle Malbog,TRUE,2,2018-06-03T17:14:09.348Z,1,My fiance and I had brunch here for the first time today and we will not come back again. Our bad experience started right from the beginning when we asked to get milk for our coffee and got cream instead. There's not a lot to choose from their menu. No one refilled or even asked a refill for our coffee until we were about to leave. No one checked up on us asking how the food was or if we needed anything else. I asked for over medium eggs and got over easy eggs. And then we sat for about 10-15 min for someone to give us the bill but no one was available. My fiance tried to get someone at the front but there was no one there. It wasn't crazy busy but maybe it's understaffed. Nonetheless I don't recommend this place to anyone.

 We waited at the desk for ten minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there.
 We heard our waitress tell another server not to put more people in her section. We waited for an unreasonably long time before our server came.
 
 We were told how busy it had been earlier so that was why they were behind. We were there half an hour before our waters came. At least 10 minutes more before our milkshakes came and they were not great at all.
 Rest of food was mediocre at best and we didn't feel too great after eating it.

Jim Turner,TRUE,0,2016-05-03T03:36:15.617Z,4,"Not sure where the negative reviews come from. I had a perfectly fine experience. The service was quick, attentive, and courteous. I ordered a bacon cheddar burger with fries which tasted fine. While perhaps not the very greatest burger I've ever had, it was still delicious, and I finished every last bite. The best part however was the music. It's like they had my Classic Rock playlist straight out of Spotify. Pink Floyd was playing when I arrived. That was followed by AC/DC, Journey, Credence Clearwater Revival, Neil Young, and a raft of other great artists. The menu has enough variety for me to return tomorrow evening to see what's playing then."
Chris Frauts,TRUE,0,2016-04-21T16:59:41.471Z,3,Service was really good. It's attached to the hotel I usually stay at in Edmonton so it's convenient. Food is okay. Can't go wrong with their burgers.

 I had the vegetarian curry bowl which was incredible. I took a couple Brits with me, and they loved the fish and chips.
 
 Also, the Nat Bailey Pale Ale by Granville Island is on point."
Don Walden,FALSE,0,2016-03-02T22:39:15.506Z,1,"When I left my hotel room shortly after checking in, my stomach was yearning for a great meal. Hell, I would've eaten McDonalds and been satisfied.
 My Father and I were seated immediately - the place was empty - and we ordered a few beers. If they hadn't been as warm as the urine I excreted just moments before I sat down to write this review, they would have been the best part of our White Spot experience. I ordered a burger with no tomato, and my old man ordered a steak. The food arrived about fifteen minutes after we had spent twenty minutes forcing down our warm beer.
 I thanked the waitress - who looked as though she would rather be anywhere but at the good ol' White Spot - and took a chomp out of my cold and dripping burger. I relive the frozen patty terror every time I close my eyes. I peeled the three slices of soupy tomato off of the burger, and I forced down two more bites before I threw my white flag in the air and accepted defeat. My fathers meal was actually much worse, and he suffered defeat as well. When our cranky spanky waitress adorned us with her presence once more, she took the barely eaten food away and pretended that ""all was well."" They must be used to serving utter crap and pretending that their patrons are as crazy as their chef must be. I am definitely not a food snob but you couldn't eat this glorified sewage. If I had wanted to waste $80.00, I would've had better luck at the Palace Casino.
 Don't eat here."

Each time we inquired, it would be ""just a few more minutes"") We were finally shown a table in the corner at the back, and then waited another 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink orders. (We had to flag her down) She then told us she was never informed that she had customers at that table. The food is mediocre. The hostess is disorganized and overwhelmed when they are busy. The manager wasn't smiling or apologizing, but was instead very obviously frustrated as he slammed a bunch of menus on the hostess table and walked away without making eye contact with any customers. Will never be going back."
